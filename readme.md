Simple Node.js Server with Express and HTML Homepage

This is a simple Node.js server using Express and a HTML homepage. It can be used as a starting point for building your own web applications.

To run the server, clone this repository and install the dependencies:
cd NODE-JS-EXAMPLE
npm install

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running the following command:
npm run start

The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the homepage.

Usage
To use the server, you can create new routes and endpoints in the app.js file. Express provides a variety of methods for creating routes, such as get(), post(), and put().

For example, the following route will serve the homepage when a user visits the root URL of the website:

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/public/index.html');
});
You can also create routes to handle specific requests, such as a POST request to submit a form:

app.post('/submit', function(req, res) {
  // Handle the form submission here.
});
Deployment
To deploy the server to production, you can use a variety of hosting providers, such as Heroku or AWS. Once you have deployed the server, you will need to update the DNS records for your domain to point to the server's IP address.
