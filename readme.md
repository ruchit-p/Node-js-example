# Node.js Example with Express

This repository showcases a simple Node.js server using the Express framework, complemented with a basic HTML homepage. It serves as a foundational template for those looking to kickstart their web application projects.

## Features

- **Express Server**: A lightweight and efficient server setup using Express. [View Code](https://github.com/ruchit-p/Node-js-example/blob/main/index.js)
  
- **HTML Homepage**: A basic homepage rendered using HTML. [View Code](https://github.com/ruchit-p/Node-js-example/blob/main/home.html)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruchit-p/Node-js-example.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Node-js-example
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the homepage.

## Usage

To expand upon this template, you can create new routes and endpoints in the `index.js` file. Express offers a multitude of methods for route creation, including `get()`, `post()`, and `put()`.

For instance, the current setup serves the homepage when the root URL is accessed:

```javascript
app.get('/', async (request, response) => {
    response.send(await readFile('./home.html', 'utf8'));
});
```

Feel free to add more routes to cater to specific functionalities, such as form submissions or API endpoints.

## Deployment

For deploying this server to a production environment, consider using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting provider of your choice. After deployment, ensure to update the DNS records of your domain to point to the server's IP address.
